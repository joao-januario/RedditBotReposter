Installation instructions:

On a command line type pip install praw

If you get an error saying pip ins't recognized by the OS you can either add python to your system PATH or open the command line from the python folder (shift+right click -> open command line, on windows).

The default python directory on windows is C:\Users\<YourUser>\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\<Your Python Version>

After praw is installed just right click and select open with python and it should work.

During the configuration process the program will ask for a "Target", the target means that you will post a comment everytime your target posts a comment. NOTE: The program might not work if you just type a random name, insert PresidentObama if you have no interest in this feature.
